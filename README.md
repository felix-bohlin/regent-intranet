# Regent Intranet 2.0

## IMPORTANT!!!

**NEVER** use real world logged in data as long as this repo isn't a Regent repo.

## Good to know

- Built with [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/).
- No direct commits to main branch, only PR's
- Use semantic commit messages (see below)

## Semantic commit messages

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

## TODO

1. move repo to some kind of Regent account/server
2. sort out strategy for localization - two domains? One domain?
3. CMS or no CMS?
4. Login - what to do?
5. Configure search
